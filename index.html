                <p>I thought this tree picture was pretty cool. I think I like the background that boxes in the body too.</p>
                
                <p>This was a picture I took by the engineering building. It was zoomed in on my phone so it's kind of grainy but
                    it was a golden moment!

                <p>It was awesome how the snow had covered the top half of the mountin and how the evening light made the whole
                    scene golden. The fall colors where still there to some extent and that added to it. I just wish I had a better
                    phone at the time.
